Just finished the "Fundamentals" level with JavaScript at “SoftUni” and about to continue with the next level JS Web Developer and realized coding is what will make me enjoy working. Proactive, customer-orientated retail professional with over 17 years of experience. Highly capable of getting the most out of my team, leading by example and inspiring each person to deliver an awesome experience to our customers. This in turn ensures that the company achieves the highest sales and profitability possible. I am a very creative person and have implemented lots of ideas and initiatives for both staff and customers that have produced great results. Received two Passion Awards for delivering outstanding service and have consistently surpassed my target KPIs for mystery shoppers. Managed successfully a franchise store for 4 years. I have a professional and confident telephone manner.
